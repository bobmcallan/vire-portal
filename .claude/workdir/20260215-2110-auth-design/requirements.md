# Requirements: Authentication Design Document

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Requested:** Create a document describing the authentication system requirements — email/password, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth — and the portal/server changes needed. Dev login should mirror the OAuth flow for testing.

## Scope
- In scope: design document covering auth architecture, JWT changes, portal changes, server changes, implementation phases
- Out of scope: implementation (this is documentation only)

## Deliverable
- `docs/authentication.md` — full design document
